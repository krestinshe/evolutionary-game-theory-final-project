# Insights from Simulations and Phase Diagrams of Animal Conflicts: An Extended Analysis of John Maynard Smith and George Robert Price’s “The Logic of Animal Conflict”

Final project for ECON 4022 - Game Theory II, taken in spring 2022 at Cornell University with Professor Lawrence Blume

This project deals with a 1973 paper by Maynard Smith and Price, "The Logic of Animal Conflict," in which they use evolutionary game theory and computer simulations to analyze the fitness of "total war" versus "limited war" strategies of conflict among animals of the same species. For my final project, I reproduced their simulations and results using Python code, interpret and explain their findings, and explore the implications of their findings on animal population dynamics using phase diagrams made with R.

Contents: 
- simulation.ipynb contains the Python code that I used to run simulations of animal conflict (Appendix A). 
- animal conflict dynamics.Rmd contains the R code that I used to plot phase diagrams of animal populations (Appendix B).
- Christine Shi ECON 4022 Final Project.pdf is the paper portion of my final project, without the appendices.
- The final-paper-versions folder contains all the different versions of my final paper -- the paper combined with the two appendices, the paper itself without appendices, and the two appendices on their own.
